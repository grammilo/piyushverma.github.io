## Piyush Verma

I am a data analytics professional. Currently I am finishing my masters in Business Analytics from [Carl H Lindner School of Business at the University](http://business.uc.edu/) of Cincinnati, Ohio. With my masters degree at UC, I am transitioning from Data Analyst to a Data Scientist. At UC I have taken courses in Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling, Probability Models, Statistical Methods and Optimization among many others.

Before enrolling in my masters in 2017, I have worked as a Data Analyst for a Sydney based management consulting firm called [Quantium Analytics](https://www.quantium.com/) from 2014 to 2017. I worked on generating competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client and supported a supermarket client in revamping their $500 million loyalty rewards program. This experience had been crucial in launching my career into data science. 

I have completed my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2014.
