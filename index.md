## Piyush Verma

I am a data analytics professional. Currently I am pursuing my masters in Business Analytics from Carl H Lindner School of Business at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio. With my masters degree at UC, I am transitioning from Data Analyst to a Data Scientist. The relevant courses I have taken in my curriculum are Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling, Probability Models, Statistical Methods and Optimization among many others.

Before enrolling in my masters in 2017, I have worked as a Data Analyst for a Sydney based management consulting firm called Quantium Analytics from 2014 to 2017. I worked on generating competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client and supported a supermarket client in revamping their $500 million loyalty rewards program. This experience has been crucial in launching my career into data science. 

I have completed my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur in 2014.
