<br />

After graduating from IIT Kharagpur in 2014, I worked in Quantium Analytics between 2014 and 2017. I worked in 2 different teams: *Competitive Intelligence* arm of insurance team and *Loyalty Analytics* arm of retail team.<br /> 

<br />

**Analyst, Retail, Dec 2015 - April 2017<br />**
  *R, Teradata SQL, Excel, VBA, Spark*<br /><br />
Worked closely with the General Manager of the Loyalty Rewards Program of one of the Australian supermarket giant. Supported client in  understanding the health of rewards program by building couple of reporting layers centered around:<br />
  - high-level KPIs reflecting the business trend and their comparison with past quarters and years<br />
  - deep-dive analysis on how customers earn reward points through different channels<br />
  - churn of customers between different segments<br />
  - showing the gaps in rewards program and its reach to customers<br />
  - performing customer segmentation using K-means Clustering, Customer Value Model and Share Of Wallet Model in Apache Spark<br />
  - building a customer propensity model to predict whether a customer will redeem a reward coupon soon 
  - moving to Sydney-Australia as a **Subject Matter Expert** (2016)<br />
  - leading a team of microstrategy software developers and client's Business Intelligence team to deploy the above Quantium Solution in-house<br />
        **Results**:<br />
  - revamp of $500 million loyalty rewards program by the business<br />
  - introduction of a base rewards earn rate of 5% for every customer on every transaction<br />
  - scanning of loyalty cards from active customers increased by ~5%. Which meant more transactions can be linked to customer's shopping behavior. 


 **Graduate Analyst, Insurance, July 2014 - Dec 2015**<br />
  *R, SQL, Excel, VBA*<br /><br />
Generated competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client, focusing on comprehensive car insurance. Insights enabled client to understand their online premium quotes' competitiveness among their competitors. I used Lasso Regression, Cross-Validation and Multiple Linear Regression techniques to identify the factors determining the competitors' premiums. The data used for the analysis was collected by scraping multiple competitors' website for a variety of customer segments. Apart from working on the regular deliverables, I also improved the process by: 
  - Adding a layer of quality check to spot online premium discounts. For this I integrated EXCEL with the SQL tables. This simple idea tracked the premium for the same quote every week and if any competitor offered a new online discount, it would track it and made sure the analyst didn't miss it in the analysis.
