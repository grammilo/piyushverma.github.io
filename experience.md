<br/>

After graduating from IIT Kharagpur in 2014, I worked in Quantium Analytics between 2014 and 2017. I worked in 2 different teams: **Competitive Intelligence** arm of insurance team and **Loyalty Analytics** arm of retail team.<br /> 

<br />

**Analyst, Retail, Dec 2015 - April 2017<br />**
  *R, Teradata SQL, Excel, VBA, Spark*<br /><br />
Worked closely with the General Manager of the Loyalty Rewards Program of one of the Australian supermarket giant. Projects were related to understanding the engagement of the shoppers with the loyalty program, customer segmentation and creating reporting layers. Some of the tasks were:<br />
  - Building propensity models to target customers most likely to buy a product in the next campaign<br />
  - Performing Customer Churn analysis to identify at risk customers soon to lapse based on historical shopping data<br /> 
  - Creating an excel based customer health dashboard with 150+ KPI to identify gaps and profitable channels in the loyalty rewards program<br />
  - Analyzing billion rows of data collected from the loyalty card transactions done by supermarket shoppers<br />
  - moving to Sydney-Australia as a **Subject Matter Expert** (2016)<br />
  - Leding a team of software developers and business analysts to deploy the Quantium Solution in-house (Sydney, Australia)<br />
  - Performing customer segmentation based on customersâ€™ shopping pattern using customer value & share of wallet models<br />
  - Programming stored procedures in Teradata SQL to create reproducible code pipelines to refresh segments weekly<br />
        
       **Results**:<br />
  - Chain of insights led client to revamp its $500 million loyalty rewards program and introduced a 0.5% default cash back on every loyalty card linked transaction<br />
  - Revamping loyalty program improved scanning of loyalty cards by 5% (~450,000 more linked transactions every week)<br />

<br />

 **Graduate Analyst, Insurance, July 2014 - Dec 2015**<br />
  *R, SQL, Excel, VBA*<br /><br />
Generated competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client, focusing on comprehensive car insurance. Insights enabled client to understand their competitiveness against other competitors. I mainly used Lasso Regression technique to identify the factors determining a competitor's premiums. The data used for the analysis was collected by scraping multiple competitors' website for a number of customer segments. Apart from working on the regular deliverables, I also improved the process by: 
  - Adding a layer of quality check to spot online premium discounts. For this I integrated EXCEL with the SQL tables. This simple idea tracked the premium for the same quote every week and if any competitor offered a new online discount, it would track it and made sure the analyst didn't miss it in the analysis.
