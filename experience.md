Worked closely with the General Manager of the Loyalty Rewards Program of one of the Australian supermarket giant. Projects were related to understanding the engagement of the shoppers with the loyalty program, customer segmentation and creating reporting layers. Some of the tasks were:<br />

  - Analyzed a billion rows of card transaction data done by loyalty card holders generating meaningful insights<br />
  - Programmed stored procedures in Teradata SQL creating reproducible code pipelines to refresh segments weekly<br />
  - Created excel based customer health dashboard with 150 KPI to identify gaps and profitable channels in the rewards program<br />

       **Results**:<br />
  - Chain of insights led the client to revamp its $500 million loyalty rewards program and introduced a 0.5% default cash back on every loyalty card linked transaction<br />
  - Revamping rewards program improved scanning of loyalty cards by 5% (~450,000 more linked transactions every week)<br />
  - A continuous increase in number of active shoppers base since launch<br />

 **Quantium: Competitive Intelligence Team**<br />
  *R, SQL, Excel, VBA*<br /><br />
Generated competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client, focusing on comprehensive car insurance. Insights enabled client to understand their competitiveness against other competitors. I mainly used Lasso Regression technique to identify the factors determining a competitor's premiums. The data used for the analysis was collected by scraping multiple competitors' website for a number of customer segments. Apart from working on the regular deliverables, I also improved the process by: 
  - Adding a layer of quality check to spot online premium discounts. For this I integrated EXCEL with the SQL tables. This simple idea tracked the premium for the same quote every week and if any competitor offered a new online discount, it would track it and made sure the analyst didn't miss it in the analysis.
