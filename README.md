# Welcome !!!!


Thanks for coming here. 

This is the space where I am maintaining my web-portfolio. I am regularly updating my profile and adding projects to showcase my data science skill-sets.

I am data science professional with 5 years in the field: 4 years in an industrial setup and 1 year of focussed masters. I have worked in India, Australia and currently working for Discover Products in Chicago, IL. 

My next goal for my pet project: *To build a web-application (or a web-visualization) analyzing live streaming of some kind of user data using Pyspark (can be twitter/instagram or soemthing else, mainly coming from an API)*.  

If you have an interesting opening and my profile interests you, let's connect and discuss.
