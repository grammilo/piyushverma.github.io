# Welcome !!!!


Thanks for coming here. 

This is the space where I am maintaining my web-portfolio. I am regularly updating my profile and adding projects to showcase my data science skill-sets.

I am data science professional with three years of demonstrated experience in retail and insurance analytics. I have worked in India and Australia. Currently, I am pursuing Business Analytics from the University of Cincinnati Ohio. I am looking for fulltime opportunities where I can apply data science topics like machine learning and advanced statistics on a daily basis and where I am constantly upgrading my skill-sets. 

Coming to programming, I am super comfortable in writing SQL and R codes. I am transitioning myself to Python these days. I also have good working knowledge of Tableau, VBA (Visual Basic Application = Advanced Excel), Arena (System Simulation software), HTML and SAS.

My next goal for my pet project: *To build a web-application (or a web-visualization) analyzing live streaming of some kind of user data using Pyspark (can be twitter/instagram or soemthing else, mainly coming from an API)*.  

If you have an interesting opening and my profile interests you, let's connect and discuss.
